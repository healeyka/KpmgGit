This project was a joint effort between Peter Episcopo, Kyle Healey, Olivia Lee, Eric Baker, and Jeff Cheng to create 
a travel booking website for KPMG. It utilizes multiple APIs including Google Flights, Rome2Rio, Hotwire, OpenWeather, and Rioboard 
to get flight, hotel, car, and train booking information from user entered search criteria. This booking information is stored in an Azure hosted SQL Database.
In addition, personal user information is stored including user account type which is used to determine the functionality of the website upon login.
For example, assistant user types have access to a drop down box on the login page which allows them to book for employees whom they are assistants of.
